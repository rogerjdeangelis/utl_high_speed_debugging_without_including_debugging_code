    The ones ending in h input highlighted text in progra, log, output or any open notepads.

    You can put these command macros on funtions keys or mouse actions ( I have 20 mapped to mouse actions)
       avgh     proc means last dataset  ```
       cnt      cnt name*sex - last dataset number unique combinations  ```
       cnth     cnt name*sex - hi-lited dataset  ```
       cntv     cnt hi-lited variable last dataset  ```
       con      contents last dataset  ```
       conh     contents hi-lited dataset  ```
      *debugh   macro debug hi-lited  ```
      *dmp      contents with sample data  ```
      *dmph     contents with sample data hi-lited dataset  ```
      *frq      freq sex*age last dataset  ```
      *frqh     freq sex*age hi-lited dataset  ```
       frqv     freq hilited variable last dataset  ```
       iota     column of consecutive integers  ```
      *ls40     40 obs last dataset  ```
      *ls40h    40 obs hi-lited dataset  ```
       lsal     all obs last dataset  ```
       parh     does hi-lited code have matched paraentheses  ```
       proch    syntax for the proc - hi-lite 'proc reg' and get syntax with example  ```
      *prtw     prtw 'sex="M"' - last dataset subset printed  ```
      *prtwh    prtw 'sex="M"' - hi-lited dataset subset printed  ```
       sumh     statistics on hi-lited column of numbers  ```
       sumv     statistics on hi-lited variable last dataset  ```
       unv      proc univariate on variable in last dataset  ```
       vu       viewtable last dataset  ```
       vuh      viewtable hi-lited dataset  ```
      *xlsh     view and edit hi-lited dataset in excel (may need a sleep w slow systems)  ```
      *xplo     xplo SUBaSUM put exploded chars in past buffer  ```
